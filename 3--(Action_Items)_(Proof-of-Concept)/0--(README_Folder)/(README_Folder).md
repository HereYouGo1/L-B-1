# Action Items Proof of Concept - Overview

This folder contains the proof of concept for the Action Items system - Chris's framework for making LLM failures deterministic and trackable. The idea is to break complex tasks into atomic "LEGO blocks" that can be tested, tracked, and debugged when agents inevitably fail.

## What This Proves

We successfully demonstrated that:
1. **Action items work** - Each performs a specific, testable task
2. **Workflows chain properly** - 5 steps executed in sequence
3. **Failures are trackable** - We can pinpoint exactly where agents fail
4. **Error patterns emerge** - The database captures failure contexts for analysis
5. **Real bugs get caught** - Found 6 actual issues in our test file

## Folder Contents

### Core Files

**action_executor.py**
The main execution engine that simulates how agents would run action items. It includes:
- Individual action implementations (_scan_file, _check_syntax, etc.)
- Workflow execution logic with failure handling
- Error recording for the learning database
- A simulation of agent failure (lines 282-287) showing how we'd catch mistakes

**(Action_Items)_(Complete_Vision).md**
The complete documentation of Chris's vision - from the core insight about LLM failures to the cross-domain transfer learning potential. This is the "why" behind everything.

### Subfolder Structure

The folders within this directory contain the core components of the Action Items proof of concept. These are ordered by relevance (most important components first).

**1--(Action_Definitions)/**
- Contains `action_items.json` defining each action item's inputs, outputs, and known failure modes
- These are the LEGO blocks - atomic, testable, versionable

**2--(Workflows)/**
- Contains `code_review_v1.json` showing how actions chain together
- Defines failure handling rules (abort, continue, warn)
- Success criteria for the complete workflow

**3--(Test_Files)/**
- Contains `buggy_code.py` with 6 intentional bugs
- Tests undefined variables, missing imports, syntax issues, etc.
- Proves the system catches real problems

**4--(Error_Database)/**
- Contains `errors.json` recording agent failures
- Shows simulated failure where agent missed undefined variables
- This data drives systematic workflow improvements

## How It Works

1. **Define action items** - Specific tasks with clear inputs/outputs
2. **Chain into workflows** - Sequence of actions with failure rules
3. **Execute and track** - Run actions, log results
4. **Record failures** - When agents fail, capture context
5. **Identify patterns** - Same failures at same context lengths
6. **Fix systematically** - Update workflows based on patterns

## The Key Innovation

It's not just error tracking - it's creating a **compiler for LLM behavior**. Instead of hoping LLMs work, we'll KNOW:
- Which actions succeed 95% of the time
- Which need chunking at >4000 tokens
- Which fail on edge cases
- How to fix each failure mode

## Next Steps

To move from proof of concept to production:
1. Have real agents execute workflows (not simulation)
2. Build 10-20 more action items
3. Create workflow versioning system
4. Test on real projects
5. Build automatic workflow optimization from error patterns

## Why This Matters

Traditional approaches either use deterministic tools (inflexible) or pure LLMs (unpredictable). Chris's hybrid approach gives us deterministic actions with LLM execution - trackable, debuggable, systematically improvable.

After 50-100 projects, we'd have battle-tested workflows that turn LLM development from art to engineering.
